This repository contains R scripts for analyzing historical stock price data of AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.). 

Analyses include time series visualization, moving averages calculation, returns analysis, time series decomposition, and forecasting using ARIMA and ETS models. 

I use quantmod and forecast for analysis and ggplot2 for data visualization.
